1 No words, characters or new lines
2 1 character words no newline
3 1 character word with newline
4 just a newline
5 just blanks tabs and newlines

Bugs found: when there are 0 words entered there should be 0 words
but state is set to OUT allowing for words to be 1 if there are no characters
but there is a new line

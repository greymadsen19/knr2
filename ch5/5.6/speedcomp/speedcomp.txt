It is true that using
an array directly without using
alloc may improve the speed that
the readlines program runs. But
with the computing power
of a standard desktop there is
only a slight change in performance
that likely won't be noticed without
running a timer to compare the runtimes of the
two implementations. Therefore, making
these adjustments would be better suited for
certain uses that may require this extra performance
on systems that would benefit from this.
